# 1. Letâ€™s apply all of the concepts you have learned one more time!

# Create a variable called skill_completed and set it equal to the string "Python Syntax".

skill_completed = "Python Syntax"

# 2 Create a variable called exercises_completed and set it equal to 13. Create another variable called points_per_exercise and set it equal to 5.

exercises_completed = 13

#The amount of points for each exercise may change, because points don't exist yet

points_per_exercise = 5

# 3 Create a variable called point_total and set it equal to 100.

point_total = 100

# 4 Update point_total to be the original value plus the result of multiplying exercises_completed and points_per_exercise.

point_total += (exercises_completed * points_per_exercise)

# 6 Print a string to the console that says:
# I got X points!
# with the value of point_total where X is.
print("I got "+ str(point_total) + " points!")
