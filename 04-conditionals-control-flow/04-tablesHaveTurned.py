# For each boolean value in the editor, write an expression that evaluates to that value. Remember, comparators are: ==, !=, >, >=, <, and <=.

# Use at least three different ones!

# Don’t just use True and False! That’s cheating!

# Create comparative statements as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me true!
bool_one = 3 < 5  # We already did this one for you!

# Make me false!
bool_two = 10 == 7 ** 80

# Make me true!
bool_three = 182 >= 44

# Make me false!
bool_four = 40 != 4 * 10

# Make me true!
bool_five = 122 <= 40 * 120

print(bool_one)
print(bool_two)
print(bool_three)
print(bool_four)
