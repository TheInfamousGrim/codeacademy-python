# 1.

# Youâ€™ll need to do two things here:

#     Type import math on line 2 in the editor.
#     Insert math. before sqrt() so that it has the form math.sqrt(). This tells Python not only to import math, but to get the sqrt() function from within math. Then hit Run to see what Python now knows.

import math

print(math.sqrt(25))
