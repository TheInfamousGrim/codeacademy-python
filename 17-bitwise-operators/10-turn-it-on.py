# You can also use masks to turn a bit in a number on using |. For example, letâ€™s say I want to make sure the rightmost bit of number a is turned on. I could do this:

# a = 0b110 # 6
# mask = 0b1 # 1
# desired =  a | mask # 0b111, or 7

# 1.

# In the editor is a variable, a. Use a bitmask and the value a in order to achieve a result where the third bit from the right of a is turned on. Be sure to print your answer as a bin() string!

a = 0b10111011

mask = 0b100

desired = a | mask

print(bin(desired))
