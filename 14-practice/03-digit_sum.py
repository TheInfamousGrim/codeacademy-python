# Write a function called digit_sum that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all that numberâ€™s digits. For example: digit_sum(1234) should return 10 which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. (Assume that the number you are given will always be positive.)

# Check the hint if you need help!

def digit_sum(n):
    total = 0
    stringifiedNumber = str(n)
    for digit in stringifiedNumber:
        total += int(digit)
    return total

print(digit_sum(1234))
